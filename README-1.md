Project Overview

Objective:
This project explores how artificial intelligence and time series analysis can be harnessed to predict stock prices. The goal is to create predictive models that can analyze historical financial data, capture market trends, and forecast future prices with high accuracy. By employing advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques such as ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM networks, the project aims to provide insights that can aid traders, analysts, and investors in making data-driven decisions.

Significance:
Stock markets are inherently volatile and influenced by a wide range of factors. Traditional statistical methods often fall short in capturing the nonlinear and dynamic nature of financial time series. AI offers more powerful tools to learn from large datasets, adapt to changing market conditions, and detect complex patterns that may not be visible to human analysts.

Scope:
The project includes data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, training and evaluation, and deployment considerations. It also involves a comparative analysis of different models in terms of their prediction accuracy and computational efficiency
